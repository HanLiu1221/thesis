%Facilitating user design of 3D contents remains a challenge in geometric modeling. Instead of intuitively creating models from scratch, a more popular trend is to extract intrinsic patterns from exemplar inputs (e.g., shape collections and sketches), to produce creative models while preserving the induced constraints. The modeling process contains two main stages, analysis and synthesis. The analysis of input models is usually performed on the part level, especially for man-made objects that can be decomposed into several semantic parts, such as the seat and handles of a bicycle. The synthesis stage recombines parts of shapes to generate new models that usually have topological or geometric variations. %
%After that, a validity check is sometimes necessary to ensure the constraints are satisfied with user guided design requirements. Recent work focus on either extracting synthesis rules from a collection of shapes, or deforming models with certain patterns, e.g., repetitive elements, symmetry structures, etc.
%Using a graph representation of shape elements and their relations, we extract and present controllable components to users for supporting designs.

%Various modeling tools have been developed for serving architectural design and artistic creation. However, these tools are usually complicated and professional training are required. In this thesis, we propose several design tools aiming at easing the modeling process from single objects to near regular scenes. We focus on man-made structures and scenes such as buildings and furniture, as these kinds of shapes can be analyzed in component level along with functional relations among parts. New models can be created through recombining shape parts following geometric and topological rules.

In this thesis, we propose several design tools aimed at easing the modeling process. We focus on man-made objects and scenes such as buildings and furniture, as the functionality of such shapes can be analyzed at component level. Thereby a relation graph, which is commonly used in shape analysis, can be used to represent the models. In our work, the graph nodes denote the elements of a model (e.g., shape parts, strokes, etc.), while the edges capture the inner relations between connected elements. With the graph representation, we extract and present controllable components to users for supporting designs.

%Relation graph is commonly used for shape analysis in part-based modeling. In our work, the input is represented by a graph whose nodes denote the elements of an object, while the edges naturally capture the inner relations between connected elements. Instead of adding virtual edges or nodes in order to depict specific patterns of a shape like symmetry, we study the intrinsic connectivity of a shape to reduce additional constraints. The relation graph can be mutated automatically or manipulated by user controls, forming new shapes conforming to the abstracted rules.

We introduce our work from three aspects: (i) First, we work on interior layout design which allows users to manipulate graph nodes instantiated by a real floor plan, i.e., changing the scales of nodes (i.e., rooms) or their connections. When the user modifies the topology of a layout, the corresponding graph is updated and the geometry is optimized under certain constraints, including user specified scales or adjacency of rooms, and fabrication considerations like the construction cost. (ii) In the second work, we focus on substructure detection from input shape graphs. Based on semantic labeling on graph nodes provided by users, we propose new automatic operations to discover replaceable substructures across or within shapes. We enforce a pair of subgraphs matching along their boundaries so that switching two subgraphs results in topological variations. In a further step, we extend the creation process to freeform design by sketching guided modeling. Geometric contents are extracted from sketching with a few user annotations. We present a system that accepts user input strokes as metastructures, analyzes their connections and vanishing directions associated with an anchored image, and projects 2D strokes to 3D space via a multi-stage optimization on spatial canvas selection.
